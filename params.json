{"name":"RackHD™","tagline":"RackHD™ (Rack Hardware Director) provides hardware management and orchestration services","body":"# RackHD&trade;\r\n\r\nRackHD (Rack Hardware Director) is a technology stack up created for enabling hardware management and orchestration, to provide cohesive APIs to enabled automated infrastructure. In a Converged Infrastructure Platform (CIP) architecture, RackHD software provides hardware management and orchestration\r\n(M&O). It serves as an abstraction layer between other M&O layers and the underlying physical hardware. Developers can use the RackHD API to create a user interface that serves as single point of access for managing hardware services regardless of the specific hardware in place.\r\n\r\nThis repository acts as a single source location to help you get or build all the pieces to learn about, take advantage of, and contribute to RackHD.\r\n\r\n## Contributing  \r\n\r\nThe RackHD project is a collection of libraries and applications housed at https://github.com/RackHD/.
