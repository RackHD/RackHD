{"name":"RackHD","tagline":"RackHD for EMC's Hyper-converged infrastructure efforts","body":"# RackHD\r\n\r\nRackHD is a technology stack up created for enabling hardware management and operations, to provide cohesive APIs to enabled automated infrastructure. In a Converged Infrastructure Platform (CIP) architecture, RackHD software provides hardware management and orchestration\r\n(M&O). It serves as an abstraction layer between other M&O layers and the underlying physical hardware. Developers can use the RackHD API to create a user interface that serves as single point of access for managing hardware services regardless of the specific hardware in place.\r\n\r\nThis repository acts as a single source location to help you get or build all the pieces to learn about, take advantage of, and contribute to RackHD.\r\n\r\n## Contributing  \r\n\r\nThe RackHD project is a collection of libraries and applications housed at https://github.com/RackHD/. The code for RackHD is a combination of Python, Javascript (NodeJS), and C, available under the Apache 2.0 license (or compatible sublicences for library dependencies).\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\nThe documentation is hosted at http://rackhd.readthedocs.org and describes how to install, run, and setup RackHD.\r\n\r\n## Licensing\r\n\r\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the “License”); you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.
