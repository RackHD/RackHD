# RackHD

RackHD &trade; is a technology stack up created for enabling hardware management and operations, to provide cohesive APIs to enabled automated infrastructure. In a Converged Infrastructure Platform (CIP) architecture, RackHD software provides hardware management and orchestration
(M&O). It serves as an abstraction layer between other M&O layers and the underlying physical hardware. Developers can use the RackHD API to create a user interface that serves as single point of access for managing hardware services regardless of the specific hardware in place.

This repository acts as a single source location to help you get or build all the pieces to learn about, take advantage of, and contribute to RackHD.
