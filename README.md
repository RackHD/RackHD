# RackHD&trade;

> RackHD is a new open source project in active development by Dell EMC.  If you have questions or would like to contact us about the RackHD project, you can contact us via email at our projects mailing list: rackhd@googlegroups.com

RackHD is a technology stack created for enabling hardware management and orchestration, to provide cohesive APIs to enable automated infrastructure. In a Converged Infrastructure Platform (CIP) architecture, RackHD software provides hardware management and orchestration
(M&O). It serves as an abstraction layer between other M&O layers and the underlying physical hardware. Developers can use the RackHD API to create a user interface that serves as single point of access for managing hardware services regardless of the specific hardware in place.
