# Packer Build Templates and scripts

These scripts and templates are for [packer](https://www.packer.io), and expect
it to be be installed locally. If you don't, you can install it on a Mac using
homebrew:

    brew install packer

or retrieving it from the download available at https://www.packer.io/downloads.html
The builds are pre-configured with post-processors to push the results to
ATLAS, and need relevant configuration set in environment variables to
enable:

    export ATLAS_USERNAME=${USER}
    export ATLAS_NAME=rackhd
    export ATLAS_TOKEN="..........................."
