## DOCUMENTATION

  The monorail_rack setup script is an easy "one button push" script to deploy an virtual rack within virtualbox to emulate a monorail server and some number of virtualbox PXE-booting clients. The enviornment is tied together using a virtual network called closednet set to our defualt subnet of 172.31.128.x for servicing DHCP and TFTP to the PXE clients.

## PRE-REQS

  We expect the latest version of GIT, Vagrant, and Ansible installed onto the host system.

## SET UP INSTRUCTIONS


  Clone RackHD repo to your local git directory.

    i.e.
        ~/<repos directory>/RackHD/


  Within the example directory, create config and run the setup command:

    $ cd ~/<repos directory>/RackHD/example/config/

    $ cp ./monorail_rack.cfg.example ./monorail_rack.cfg

    Edits can be made to this new file to adjust the number of pxe clients created.
    Please see below for more information on the configuration file.

    $ cd ~/<repos directory>/RackHD/example/bin/

    $ ./monorail_rack

  Now ssh into the monorail server:

    $ vagrant ssh dev

  Build the discovery images from the monorail server (or any debian-based system):

    $ sudo apt-get install -y ansible
    $ git clone https://github.com/rackhd/on-imagebuilder.git
    $ cd on-imagebuilder
    $ sudo ansible-playbook -i hosts all.yml

  Place the discovery images into HTTP server's static file directory:

    $ mv /tmp/on-imagebuilder/builds/* ~/src/on-http/static/http/common/

  Bring up all monorail services:

    $ sudo nf start
      or $ sudo nf start [graph,http,dhcp,tftp,syslog]

    Now that the services are running we can begin powering on pxe clients and watch them boot.

  Provision an existing monorail server:

    $ vagrant provision

## CONFIGURATION FILE

```
# monorail_rack.cfg
# used to customize default deployment
# edit $pxe_count to change the amount of virtualbox PXE-booting clients are created when running
# the monorail_rack setup script.

# deployment variables
pxe_count=1
```

Changing the number of $pxe_count within the running configuration script will effect how many headless pxe clients are created when running the monorail_rack setup script.

Please note, and example configuration file is provided and you must copy that file to a new file with the same name excluding the .example extension.


## ENVIRONMENT BREAKDOWN

  Remove an existing monorail server:

    $ vagrant destroy

  Please note all pxe clients must to be removed by hand currently.


## CHANGE NODE VERSION

  Currently the monorail server is built with Node v0.10.40 but this can be changed.

  Install additional Node versions

    $ sudo ~/n/bin/n <version>

  Use n's menu system to change running Node version

    $ sudo ~/n/bin/n

## CHANGE CODE VERSION USED

  To checkout to a different commit than what is referenced by git submodule, edit the vagrant file (RackHD/example/Vagrantfile) to specify the branch variable for the ansible provisioner.

```
    # If you wish to use a specific commit, include the variable below.
    ansible.extra_vars = { branch: "master" }
```

## TESTING

  Test node was discovered from the monorail server:

    $ curl localhost:8080/api/1.1/nodes | python -m json.tool

  Check Cataloging has happend:

    $ mongo pxe --eval 'db.catalogs.count()'
